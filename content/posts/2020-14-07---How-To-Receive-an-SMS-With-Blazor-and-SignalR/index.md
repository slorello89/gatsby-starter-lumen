When it comes to managing SMS messages with the [Vonage Messaging API](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview), receiving inbound SMS messages is paramount. In this tutorial, we’re going to explore receiving SMS messages into our app and pushing them out to our front end in real-time using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and [SignalR Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-3.1).

## Jump Right to the Code

If you just want to jump right to the code, just visit this demo’s repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/receive-sms-blazor).

## Prerequisites

- You’ll need a Vonage API account. You can [sign up here](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up)
- You’ll need the latest version of the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- You’ll need either Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code, I will be using VS Code for this demo

## Vonage API Account

To complete this tutorial, you will need a [Vonage API account](http://developer.nexmo.com/ed?c=blog_text&ct=2020-07-14-how-to-receive-an-sms-with-blazor-and-signalr). If you don’t have one already, you can [sign up today](http://developer.nexmo.com/ed?c=blog_text&ct=2020-07-14-how-to-receive-an-sms-with-blazor-and-signalr) and start building with free credit. Once you have an account, you can find your API Key and API Secret at the top of the [Vonage API Dashboard](http://developer.nexmo.com/ed?c=blog_text&ct=2020-07-14-how-to-receive-an-sms-with-blazor-and-signalr).

## Create the App

Navigate to a directory where you want to put the project folder and run the following command in your terminal.

```text
dotnet new blazorserver -o ReceiveSmsBlazor
```

After that’s done, `cd` into the `ReceiveSmsBlazor` folder that we created and run `code .` to launch VS Code. Alternatively, you can open the `ReceiveSmsBlazor.csproj` file in Visual Studio.

## Install NuGet Packages

There are two NuGet Packages that we are going to need for this demo.

1. [Nexmo.Csharp.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nexmo.Csharp.Client/)
2. [Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client/5.0.0-preview.6.20312.15)

Go back to your console and run:

```text
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
dotnet add package Nexmo.Csharp.Client
```

## Create the SMS Hub

SignalR disperses all messages through central “Hubs.” A hub will notify all clients connected to it when a particular event occurs; in this case, the events we are going to be receiving are inbound SMS messages.

Create a folder called `Hubs`. In that folder, create a file called `SmsHub.cs` and import SignalR with `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;` within it. Then, create a SmsHub class within the `ReceiveSmsBlazor.Hubs` namespace like so:

```csharp
namespace ReceiveSmsBlazor.Hubs{ public class SmsHub : Hub { }}
```

You don’t need to add any code in here; we’ll be driving this from outside of this class, it just needs to be here so that we can talk to all the clients of the Hub.

## Build our Controller

We are going to need to create an API controller. This controller is where we are going to be receiving our inbound SMS webhooks from Vonage.

Create a new folder at the top level of our project called `Controllers`, and add a new file `SmsController.cs` to this folder.

Open up `SmsController.cs` and add the following using statements to it.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Nexmo.Api.Messaging;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using ReceiveSmsBlazor.Hubs;
```

Next, create a `SmsController` class in the `ReceiveSmsBlazor.Controllers` namespace extending `Controller` and annotate it with a `Route` to `api/[controller]` and an `ApiController` attribute like so:

```csharp
namespace ReceiveSmsBlazor.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class SmsController : Controller
    {
    }
}
```

### Inject the SmsHub Context

To access the SmsHub, we’ll dependency inject its context. Create an `IHubContext<SmsHub>` property called `HubContext` in your `SmsController` class, then add a constructor taking an `IHubContex` as an argument, and assign our `HubContext` property to that value.

```csharp
IHubContext<SmsHub> HubContext { get; set; }
public SmsController(IHubContext<SmsHub> hubContext)
{
    HubContext = hubContext;
}
```

### Add the Inbound SMS Webhook Action

Now that we have our Hub available, we just need to add a method to handle the inbound SMS and send it to our client.

Add a new async method called `InboundSms` that returns a `Task<IActionResult>`. In this method we are going to read the SMS in from the Request’s body, then we are going to send a message out to all of the clients connected to our SmsHub containing the inbound message’s `Msisdn` (the number the message originated from) and `Text`.

```csharp
[HttpPost("[action]")]
public async Task<IActionResult> InboundSms()
{
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(Request.Body))
    {
        var json = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
        var inbound = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<InboundSms>(json);
        await HubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", inbound.Msisdn, inbound.Text);
    }
    return NoContent();
}
```

If you’ve been following along, the route will look like `api/sms/inboundsms` on our server when it launches. Keep this in mind for later because this is going to be where we are aiming our webhooks when we are configuring our webhooks.

## Configure Middleware in Startup

Since we are using Controllers and SignalR, we need to make sure that we configure the middleware. Open up `Startup.cs` and add `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCompression;` to the import section. Then drop into the `ConfigureServices` method and add the following.

```csharp
services.AddSignalR();
services.AddResponseCompression(opts => {
    opts.MimeTypes = ResponseCompressionDefaults.MimeTypes
        .Concat(new []{"application/octet-stream"});
});
```

This snippet will add SignalR and response compression for SignalR to your application.

### Add Controller and SmsHub

The next thing we need to do is to tell our application to use our controllers and our SmsHub. Drop into the `Configure` method in `Startup.cs` and add the line `app.UseResponseCompression();` at the beginning of the method. Then, in the `UseEndpoints` delegate, add `endpoints.MapControllers();` and `endpoints.MapHub<Hubs.SmsHub>("/smshub");`. When it’s all said and done your `app.UseEndpoints` should look something like this:

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();
    endpoints.MapBlazorHub();
    endpoints.MapHub<Hubs.SmsHub>("/smshub");
    endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
});
```

## Add a Frontend

Now that we have all the internal stuff working for handling the inbound SMS and we have all of our services and hubs stood up, the last thing we need to do is to create a frontend.

If you ran `dotnet run` in your console and opened the app on `localhost:5001` you’d see the generic blazor starter page.

[![Generic Blazor](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GenericBlazor.png)](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GenericBlazor.png)

If you want to remove the navigation bar on the side just go into `Shared/MinLayout.razor` and remove the `sidebar` div.

Everything else we need to do is in `Pages/index.razor` so go ahead and open that file now.

### Pull in Dependencies

Delete everything below line 2 in `index.razor` as it’s just generic hello world code. With that done, let’s import our SignalR client, inject a navigation manager, and declare that we will implement IDisposable to clean up the SignalR hub when it winds down.

```csharp
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client
@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager
@implements IDisposable
```

### Add our Messages Table

We’re going to display inbound messages in a Table. Let’s go ahead and add a simple table into our `index.razor` file. Add the following razor code.

```html
<h1>Messages</h1>

<table class="table" id="messageList">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>From Number</th>
            <th>Message</th>
        </tr>
        @foreach (var message in _messages)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@message.FromNumber</td>
                <td>@message.Text</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </thead>

</table>
```

The foreach will loop through our page’s `_messages` collection and create a new row with each message’s `FromNumber` and `Text`.

### Handle Inbound Messages

Back in our controller, we used the call `await HubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", inbound.Msisdn, inbound.Text);` to send the inbound message’s `Msisdn` and `Text` down to all clients connected to the SMS hub. Now it’s time to connect to that Hub. I’m going to go ahead and show you the whole `@code` blob and then walk you through how each part operates.

```csharp
@code {
    private HubConnection _hubConnection;
    private List<Message> _messages = new List<Message>();
    private class Message
    {
        public string FromNumber { get; set; }
        public string Text { get; set; }
    }
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        _hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
            .WithUrl(NavigationManager.ToAbsoluteUri("/SmsHub"))
            .Build();
        _hubConnection.On<string, string>("ReceiveMessage", (from, text) =>
        {
            var message = new Message { FromNumber = from, Text = text };
            _messages.Add(message);
            StateHasChanged();
        });
        await _hubConnection.StartAsync();
    }
    public bool IsConnected => _hubConnection.State == HubConnectionState.Connected;
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _ = _hubConnection.DisposeAsync();
    }
}
```

#### Declare Private Fields and Message Class

The following bit of code declares the private fields of the component. That `_messages` list is where we are going to be pulling messages.

```csharp
private HubConnection _hubConnection;
private List<Message> _messages = new List<Message>();
private class Message
{
    public string FromNumber { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

#### OnInitializedAsync

We override the `OnInitializedAsync` method; this is the method that is invoked when the component is initialized. This method initializes the `_hubConnection` (the connection to our `SmsHub`). It then registers a handler for the `ReceiveMessage` callback that we are invoking with our `SmsController`. Thus whenever that event occurs, this method will fire, we’ll add the inbound message to our `_messages` collection, and then we’ll call the `StateHasChanged` function to tell the component that it needs to re-render, this will make our messages reload live. Lastly, we start `_hubConnection`.

## Testing with Ngrok

Now that we have everything built, we can go ahead and get testing with ngrok. Ngrok allows us to create a tunnel to our server from our local machine. If you are using ngrok with IIS Express, I will encourage you to check our [explainer on the subject](https://developer.nexmo.com/tools/ngrok#usage-with-iis-express) as there are special considerations. For this demo, since we are using the dotnet CLI, we don’t need to worry about this. Open up your `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in the profiles object, the profile named after your app is going to be used when you startup. Check the `applicationUrl`; it will typically point to `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000`. Ensure that you delete the non-SSL one of these and then run the following command in another command prompt window.

```
ngrok http 5000
```

Replace 5000 with whatever port number your app is going to be running without SSL.

This command will build a tunnel to that port. You can now run your application by using the `dotnet run` command. Check back at your ngrok console; it will tell you the publicly accessible URL of your app.

[![ngrok](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ngrok.png)](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ngrok.png)

In my case, it’s pointing to `http://09c1cd61e26e.ngrok.io/`. By navigating to that URL, I can see my application’s frontend.

[![](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/frontend.png)](https://www.nexmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/frontend.png)

## Configure your Webhooks

The route for inbound sms webhooks is `/api/sms/inboundsms` with our ngrok URL as the base path. This means that the full route is going to be something along the lines of `http://09c1cd61e26e.ngrok.io/api/sms/inboundsms`. All we need to do now is navigate to our [settings page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) and set the inbound messages URL to our route, and set the HTTP method to `POST-JSON`. Click the `Save Changes` button at the bottom, and we’re good to go.

## Test

To test, all we need to do is send a text message to a Nexmo Number associated with this account. That can be found on the dashboard under [numbers->Your Number](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers).

It will look something like this after you receive a message.

## Wrapping Up

That’s all that’s needed to allow us to watch SMS messages come into an app in real-time. It’s clear that by combining SignalR, Blazor, and the Vonage APIs, we can build some cool stuff!
